```sql
-- On your production MySQL server:
CREATE DATABASE uampc;
USE uampc;
-- Import schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Configuration
Edit `includes/config.php`:
```php
// For production (replace with your hosting credentials):
define('DB_HOST', 'your-db-host.com');
define('DB_NAME', 'your-db-name');
define('DB_USER', 'your-db-user');
define('DB_PASS', 'your-db-password');
```

### Step 3: File Permissions
Ensure `uploads/` directory is writable:
```bash
chmod 755 uploads/
```

### Step 4: First Login
Default admin credentials:
- **ID Number**: ADMIN001
- **Password**: admin123
- **⚠️ CHANGE THIS AFTER FIRST LOGIN!**

### Step 5: Verify Installation
Run the stress test on production:
```bash
php stress-test.php
```
